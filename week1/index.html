    <h4> CVR </h4>
    <p>
        The Cherabuddi Education Society was registered in January 1999 as an NRI-promoted society. The Society  aims at creating a state-of-the-art engineering institution in association with leading NRI technology professionals and well-known academicians of the twin states of Telangana & Andhra Pradesh.  The Society aims to harness technical excellence with a commitment to the ethos of 'useful learning'. 

Our students remain at the heart of our vision, benefiting from our innovative teaching methods, and close links with premier companies and research institutions in India and abroad. Students will enjoy engineering and will have the chance to develop skills that will last a lifetime.
